# inverter_x8
This repository contains the complete design, simulation, symbol, and layout of a CMOS Inverter (width 960 ) implemented using Cadence Virtuoso on a 90nm CMOS technology node. The inverter is the basic building block of all digital logic circuits, and this project demonstrates the full custom VLSI design flow from schematic to layout verification.
